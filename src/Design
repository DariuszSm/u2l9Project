LinearExpression class

INPUT VARIABLES

The raw x and y coordinates for point one as (x,y) for both coordinates as a string formatted like "(x,y)"

The custom x value as an int to put through the calculated equation

PROCESSED VARIABLES

The extracted x and y coordinates from the inputted coordinate strings

A double slope calculated with slope formula (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)

The y intercept as a double calculated with y1-(x1*slope)

The equation as a String representing the raw equation with the Processed variables substituting m and b

A double for the distance between the two points

METHODS

parseCoordValues: Takes in two strings, void return, that are supposed to be the coordinates for 2 points formatted as (x, y), and assigns the coordinate variables to the processed coordinate values in the class

Individual methods that take in and return void, that also manipulate the distance, slope, y intercept and equation variables with the x and y values given initially

CONSTRUCTOR: TAKES IN THE STRINGS FOR THE FIRST 2 COORDINATES
Calls parseCoordValues
Calls individual methods for each other variable aside from the solved coord point
Order for doing so is
slope
y intercept
equation
distance

solveForGivenX: Returns a string formatted (newX,newY), Takes in the custom X int and uses the linear equation formula with the other variables in the class

toString: returns a string with Concatenated string labeling all of the output variables like slope, and connecting each individual line of labels and variables with a line break

MAIN METHOD DESIGN:

Create a scanner object after importing it outside of main
Prompt user for first coord, read it with scanner and store in a variable
repeat for second variable
create a new LinearEquation object, pass the two coords as params for constructor
print the object, resulting the linear equation info getting printed out

in a while loop:
    prompt user for a custom x, collect x with scanner
    print the return of function solveForGivenX
end of while loop

done!
